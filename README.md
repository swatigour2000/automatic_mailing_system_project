# automatic_mailing_system_project
This is a project called email mailing system which is build using python and tkinter. The purpose of this project was to send mail to various employees reminding them about their holidays and weekend off’s. Information of various employees are stored in the excel sheet and when we run this program, the user interface pops up and sender can type his/her subject and body and then after clicking the send button, the employees whose record was in excel sheet will start receiving mail and after the completion of this task interface will display a alert message stating the email is sent to everyone.
